SUtility is a comprehensive functional programming library for JavaScript, providing over 180 utility functions that operate without modifying native prototypes. Designed for both browser and Node.js environments, it also includes a lightweight MV* framework to promote organized code structure. A key innovation of this library is its ability to parse a target project's codebase and generate an optimized, tree-shaken build containing only the required functions for a minimal production footprint.

As the sole author and maintainer of the library, I was responsible for its full lifecycle from conception to ongoing support. My key contributions included engineering its innovative tree-shaking feature for optimized builds, developing a comprehensive unit test suite to ensure code quality, and writing detailed API and end-user documentation for all 180+ functions.
